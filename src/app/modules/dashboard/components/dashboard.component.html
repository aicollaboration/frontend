              We will try to format the layout completely. Right now, we donâ€™t have a space that talks about who we are and our mission. I am putting an example below.
              <br/>  1.	Logo, clicking on it should help us to take it to the landing page
              <br/>    2.	Clicking on who we are, vision, mission will take us to the bottom of the Main Page.
              <br/>   3.	Solution will take to a new page where solutions are listed with descriptions 
              <br/>    4.	Services will take to a page where we can add services.

              A layout child's flex directive can be given an integer value from 0-100. The element will stretch to the
              percentage of available space matching the value. Currently, the flex directive value is restricted to
              multiples
              of five, 33 or 66.
